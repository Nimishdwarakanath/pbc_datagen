1. The number of Dihedral and Improper types increase with more number of cells.
One observation:
Dihedral:
a--b--c
       \   
        d

\_abc making close to 180 degrees are being considered for dihedrals. The problem is abc doesn't form a plane.

This results in grave problems if 1-4 interaction is scaled by less than 1.0 as merely setting the dihedral coefficient to be zero doesn't help.
