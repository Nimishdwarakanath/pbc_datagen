Each subdirectory contains the input and the corresponding LAMMPS data for IRMOF-1 unitcell generated using pbc_datagen.
The interaction between the metal atom (Zinc) and the ligand (carboxylate oxygen) are treated differently in each case.

bonded: The interaction between Zinc and carboxylate oxygen is treated as a bond (harmonic, Morse, etc.)
non-bonded: Interaction via dispersion and electrostatic (example Allendorf's FF for IRMOF-1)
dummy: Each Zinc atom is represented by 7 particles and 6 of them are ficticious and are only point charges (called dummy atoms, hence the name dummy model)
